<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>
This page contains a description of
<i lang="ga">An Crúbadán</i>,
a project aimed at the
<b>automatic development of
large text corpora for under-resourced languages</b>.
</p>

<p>
Statistical techniques are a key part of most modern 
natural language processing systems.   Unfortunately, such techniques
require the existence of large bodies of text, and in the past
corpus development has proved to be quite expensive.   As a
result, substantial corpora exist primarily for languages
like English, French, German, etc. where there is
a market-driven need for NLP tools.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind this project is to exploit the vast quantities of
text freely available on the web as a way of bringing
the benefits of statistical NLP to languages 
with small numbers of speakers and/or limited computational resources.
Initially it was deployed for the six Celtic languages,
but over the last ten years I've added support for more
than 2000 languages from all parts of the world.  
You can information about all of these languages and 
downloadable datasets on the 
<a href="writing_systems.html">Downloads Page</a>.
There is also information on various tools that
have been developed using these
corpora on the <a href="applications.html">Applications Page</a>.
</p>

I gave a presentation on this work at the
<a href="http://cental.fltr.ucl.ac.be/wac3/">WAC3 conference</a>
in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium in September of 2007.
Here is the conference paper, which is the one 
we'd ask you to cite if 
you make use of this work:
<a href="http://borel.slu.edu/pub/wac3.pdf">The Crúbadán Project: Corpus building for under-resourced languages</a>.
I am grateful to the organizers Cédrick Fairon, Adam Kilgarriff, and
Gilles-Maurice de Schryver for the invitation and to the
Université Catholique de Louvain for
financial support that made the trip possible.      
You can read the slides from my
<a href="http://borel.slu.edu/pub/wac3slides.pdf">main talk</a> and also some remarks I made
during the WAC
<a href="http://borel.slu.edu/pub/wacpanel.pdf">panel discussion</a>.

<p>
The word <i lang="ga">crúbadán</i>
means literally "crawler" in Irish, but with the additional
(appropriate in this context)
connotation of unwanted or clumsy "pawing", from the root
<i lang="ga">crúb</i> ("paw").  Several people have asked me how it is pronounced - you can now
<a href="http://borel.slu.edu/crubadan/crubadan.mp3">listen to the word</a> as it's spoken by
the wonderful Irish speech synthesizer <a href="http://www.abair.tcd.ie/index.php">abair.ie</a>.
