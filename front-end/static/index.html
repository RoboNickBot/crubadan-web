<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>
This page contains a description of my web crawling software
<i lang="ga">An Crúbadán</i>.
I've written this page
for researchers in natural language
processing (NLP) interested in corpus development and also for
webmasters of sites who have seen the software show up in their logs.
In short, the goal of the software is the 
<b>automatic development of
large text corpora for under-resourced languages</b>.
</p>

<p>
Statistical techniques are a key part of most modern 
natural language processing systems.   Unfortunately, such techniques
require the existence of large bodies of text, and in the past
corpus development has proved to be quite expensive.   As a
result, substantial corpora exist primarily for languages
like English, French, German, etc. where there is
a market-driven need for NLP tools.
</p>

<p>
My software is designed to exploit the vast quantities of
text freely available on the web as a way of bringing
the benefits of statistical NLP to languages 
with small numbers of speakers and/or limited computational resources.
Initially it was deployed for the six Celtic languages,
but more recently I've added support for a number of other languages
from all parts of the world.  
You can find an up-to-date list of languages and the 
corpus statistics for each on the
<a href="stadas.html">Status Page</a>.
There is also information on tools developed using these
corpora on the <a href="apps.html">Applications Page</a>.
</p>

I gave a presentation on this work at the
<a href="http://cental.fltr.ucl.ac.be/wac3/">WAC3 conference</a>
in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium in September of 2007.
Here is the conference paper, which is the one to cite if 
you make use of this work:
<a href="/pub/wac3.pdf">The Crúbadán Project: Corpus building for under-resourced languages</a>.
I am grateful to the organizers Cédrick Fairon, Adam Kilgarriff, and
Gilles-Maurice de Schryver for the invitation and to the
Université Catholique de Louvain for
financial support that made the trip possible.      
You can read the slides from my
<a href="/pub/wac3slides.pdf">main talk</a> and also some remarks I made
during the WAC
<a href="/pub/wacpanel.pdf">panel discussion</a>.

The remarkable image to the left was created by
<a href="http://email.eva.mpg.de/~cysouw/">Michael Cysouw</a>
of the Max Planck Institut für evolutionäre Anthropologie in Leipzig.
It illustrates the tree of language relationships as reconstructed from
the <a href="table.html">3-gram table</a> using the neighbor-joining
algorithm of Saitou and Nei.
Several language families are reproduced quite accurately, despite
the naïveté of the approach.
Here's an <a href="http://indigenoustweets.blogspot.com/2011/12/1000-languages-on-web.html">updated version of the image</a> generated in December 2011, showing 1000 languages.
</p>

<p>
The word <i lang="ga">crúbadán</i>
means literally "crawler" in Irish, but with the additional
(appropriate in this context)
connotation of unwanted or clumsy "pawing", from the root
<i lang="ga">crúb</i> ("paw").  Several people have asked me how it is pronounced - you can now
<a href="crubadan.mp3">listen to the word</a> as it's spoken by
the wonderful Irish speech synthesizer <a href="http://www.abair.tcd.ie/index.php">abair.ie</a>.
</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>
<p>
For copyright reasons, I am not allowed to make the full-text corpora
available for download from this site.   But send me an email if you're
interested in a particular language and there's plenty of data I am
free to share (frequency lists, n-grams, etc.).
</p>

<p>
For anyone interested in language identification, I've made the full corpus of character 3-grams available under the GPLv3.  See the list of <a href="http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nltk_data/index.xml">NLTK corpora</a>.

<h2>Webmasters</h2>

<ul>
<li>The downloaded content will be used for academic purposes only
and will not be republished in any form.
<li>The software respects <code>robots.txt</code>.
<li>Any given file should be downloaded just once.
<li>The software is designed to restrict downloads to sites having 
appropriate content in minority languages.  If you are seeing
many hits in your web logs and your site has, say, only
English content, please let me know.
</ul>

<p>
Thanks also to Patric Müller for his help in getting 
<a href="http://bhaak.dyndns.org/vilistextum/">vilistextum</a> to process utf-8 correctly, and to Kevin Atkinson for a number of
useful suggestions.  If you're interested in Ethiopic scripts, 
<a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~biniam/geez/">Biniam Gebremichael</a>
has managed to implement a similar system for 
<b>Tigrigna</b> and <b>Amharic</b>.
